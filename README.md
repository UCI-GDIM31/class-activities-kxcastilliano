Hello world

### W2
Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?
The reason why the r,g, and b variables are floats are due to the the fact that the values of the colors are determines by factoral numbers and change based off of small increments. (Adding 0.1 to any variable would still change it), 
it wouldn't make sense for them to be bools or strings since our main purpose of changing the game code is to change the value of the colors. Also, RGB values can only go from 0.0-1.0 so th euse of decimanls is necesarry.

Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?
the bounce variable is an int instead of a float, bool or string due to the fact that we want to change the value of how much/high the ball bounces and to do so we must see the change through adding whole number values (+1)

The error you got after Step X of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?
After trying to process the code, the console explains that there are errors in the code that need to be fixed and can't be compiled until the errors are resolved?
